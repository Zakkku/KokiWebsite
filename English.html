  <h2>The appeal of railways</h2>
  <p>There are so many attractions of trains.<br>
This site introduces just a few of them.<br>
"The design is cool." "It's exciting to be able to go far away."<br>
There is cutting-edge technology, and train windows are filled with the<br>
nature and culture of the areas along the railway lines. Also, since there<br>
are many railway fans, it is also a good place that there are many people who<br>
can share their feelings.<br>

   <h1>Railway History</h1>
   <h2>Early Railroads</h2>
   <h3>In the Meiji era, the government decided to build a railway under government management, and the construction of the railway between Shimbashi and Yokohama began. <br>
On January 17th, 1868 (December 23rd, 1868), half a month after the promulgation of the Imperial Restoration Decree in Kyoto,<br>
In the name of Nagayuki Ogasawara, foreign secretary-general of the shogunate, a license to build a railroad between Edo and Yokohama was granted to American Consular Secretary Anton Portman. <br>
This license was a "foreign jurisdiction system" in which the United States had management rights. After the Meiji era, the American side requested construction based on this license, but<br>
The Meiji government rejected the request on the grounds that ``this document was signed by the shogunate after the establishment of the new government in Kyoto and did not have diplomatic authority.'' After that, a study was conducted within the new government on railroad construction,<br>
In November 1869 (Meiji 2), it was decided to construct a railway between Shimbashi and Yokohama under the jurisdiction of the country. At that time, it was impossible for Japan to build it on its own, so the United Kingdom was selected as a country to provide technical and financial assistance. <br>
This was largely due to the recognition of the technological capabilities of Britain, the birthplace of railways, and the existence of Harry Parks, Minister to Japan, who made constructive proposals regarding railways in Japan. <br>
In the following year, 1870 (Meiji 3), Edmund Morrell was appointed chief architect from England, and full-scale construction began. On the Japanese side, in 1871 (Meiji 4), Masaru Inoue (father of Japanese railways) was appointed as the head of the mine and the head of the railroad and was involved in the construction. <br>
<br>
The Japanese railway officially opened on October 14, 1872 (September 12, 1872) between Shimbashi Station and Yokohama Station. However, a few months before that, from June 12, 1872 (May 7, 1872), provisional operations were started between Shinagawa Station and Yokohama Station. <br>
The railroad became very popular and posted a large profit in the year following its opening, but most of the fare revenue was passenger revenue. However, this line itself does not have a single tunnel, and the bridge is a wooden structure and a "sample", so the construction of a full-fledged railway line is unlikely<br>
It was carried over between Osaka and Kobe and between Osaka and Kyoto [3]. </h3>
<h2>Early days of the railroad (2)</h2>
<h3>The narrow gauge of 1,067 mm, which is narrower than the international standard gauge (1,435 mm), was selected as the gauge that determines the transportation capacity of the railway. <br>
This was a reasonable choice considering the situation in Japan at the time. In other words, the wider the gauge, the faster the large and heavy trains can run, but the drawback was that the construction cost increased. <br>
In particular, the larger the gauge, the larger the curve radius, and in Japan, a poor and mountainous country, standard gauge was a luxury. South Africa and New Zealand, which were British colonies at the time, also adopted 1,067 mm. <br>

The railway got off to a good start, but due to the government's financial difficulties after the Seinan War in 1877 (Meiji 10), most of the new construction was completed except for the Tokaido Line (1889 (Meiji 22)). stopped. Railway head Masaru Inoue and others are railways<br>
Although he insisted on national ownership in principle, the railways that had been opened by this time were between Shimbashi Station and Yokohama Station, Hokkaido's Horonai Railway (later, Temiya Line, part of Hakodate Main Line, Horonai Line) and Kamaishi Railway. , and staying between Otsu Station and Kobe Station, this is slow<br>
Because it was expected that the railway construction would not progress, mainly by Tomomi IWAKURA and Hirobumi ITO, there was a strong demand for railway construction using private capital, and in the end, it was a semi-governmental government under the protection of the government. Nippon Railway was established in 1881 (Meiji 14) as a half-private company. <br>
Japan Railway's business performance was good partly because it was protected by the government. (In addition, Nippon Railway, Hokkaido Coal Mine Railway, Kansai Railway, Sanyo Railway, and Kyushu Railway are called the Meiji "Five Major Private Railways")<br>
In addition, the content of assistance for each private railway varies greatly depending on the local circumstances of the construction, and it is speculated that the government's judgment was made carefully in providing assistance. </h3>
<h2>A train appears</h2>
<h3>As a city transportation system, the horse-drawn carriage railroad was first born, starting with the Tokyo horse-drawn railroad, which opened in 1882 (Meiji 15). <br>However, due to the problems of food and excreta, following the global trend, rail transportation using trains, that is, trams, will soon be switched to. <
The first example was the Kyoto Electric Railway, which opened in 1895 (Meiji 28). It was a streetcar that ran 6.6 km from Fushimi in the southern part of Kyoto to Kyoto city, and was powered by hydroelectric power generated by Lake Biwa Canal.
This railway was purchased by Kyoto City in 1918, and the line became part of the Kyoto City Tram.

Furthermore, the idea of using the mobility of trains for inter-city transportation is also born. This was modeled after American Interurban,
Starting with Hanshin Electric Railway in 1905 (Meiji 38), several companies and routes were born mainly in Kansai and Kanto. Many of these are the origins of current private railway lines.
Some trains, such as Nagoya Electric Railway, the predecessor of Nagoya Railroad, developed streetcars into suburban trains.

Also, in 1904 (Meiji 37), Kobu Railway started the first train operation on a route that conforms to railways instead of tracks.
It became clear that electric trains were superior to steam trains in suburban areas, and private railways such as the Nankai Railway, which had escaped nationalization, began to introduce electric trains at the end of the Meiji period.
</h3>
<h2>Nationalization of Railways</h2>
<h3>There were various trends in the nationalization of railways in the Meiji period. During the economic recessions of 1891 and 1899, private railways, which were in financial difficulties, made requests to purchase the trains, but they were turned down on both occasions. Especially in the latter case, the government was expanding its armaments in preparation for the Russo-Japanese War, which was financially impossible. During the Russo-Japanese War, the military (especially the army), keenly aware of the effectiveness of railways and the inconvenience of private railway divisions, demanded the nationalization of railways after the war. In March 1906, the "Railway Nationalization Law" was passed by the Diet, and it was decided to nationalize (acquire) 17 major private railway companies, including the five major private railway companies mentioned above. The acquisition began in October 1906 and was completed in October 1907. The total operating distance of the government railway before the acquisition was 2,459 km, and the total operating distance of the acquired and nationalized line was 4,806 km. When deciding whether or not to acquire the company, it was decided to give priority to routes that would serve as the backbone of domestic transportation. At that time, Nankai Railway was operating between Namba and Wakayama City, and Tobu Railway was operating between Kita-Senju and Kuki. Therefore, although it was included in the target of nationalization for a while, it was finally excluded due to budget problems.

After the success of the 6700 series (1911), the first purely domestic locomotive, the production of locomotives worthy of being called a "domestic standard machine" began, referring to the 8800 series and other state-of-the-art aircraft imported around the same time. . Completed in 1913, the 9600 type is a freight tender locomotive with an output of 870 horsepower and a shaft arrangement of 1D using supersaturated steam, and a total of 770 cars were produced. In the following year, the 8620 series, a tender machine with an axle arrangement of 1C, was completed for passenger use, and a total of 687 locomotives were also built (unless otherwise specified, the locomotives described below are tender machines). In 1923, the large D50 series (shaft arrangement 1D1, output 1280 horsepower) was completed in 1923. Gotemba Line) was active as an auxiliary machine. As for passenger planes, the C51 type (shaft arrangement 2C1) was completed in 1919, but this locomotive's configuration of ``shaft arrangement 2C1 and driving wheel diameter 1750 mm'' was inherited by passenger steam locomotives that were newly manufactured thereafter. (All the 2C2-type locomotives completed after the war were modified from other models). The C51 type was used for a long time as a traction machine for limited express trains on the Tokaido Main Line and Sanyo Main Line. </h3>
<h2>Railway improvements</h2>
<h3>Various items were implemented as measures to increase transportation capacity without changing the rail. Among them, there were also large-scale and highly effective projects unprecedented in the world, such as the simultaneous replacement of link-type (screw-type) couplers with automatic couplers (1925). These improvements were made in the 1910s and 1920s, resulting in the "Golden Age" of the 1930s. Below is a description of the measures implemented during this period.

Double-tracking of trunk lines-The main trunk line, the Tokaido Main Line, was double-tracked in 1913 and the Sanyo Main Line in 1928. In addition, in the suburbs of Tokyo and Osaka, parallel separate lines (train lines, so-called double tracks) were constructed.
Improvement of steep slope section -The largest one is the change from the Gotemba area on the Tokaido Main Line to the Tanna Tunnel. Along with speeding up due to the improvement of the slope, the stoppage due to the connection / disconnection of the auxiliary equipment for the slope was eliminated, and the transportation capacity of the Tokaido Line was greatly improved.
Track strengthening - heavy railing (replace rails with heavy and sturdy ones), ballast crushing (stones with corners are better for ballasting than cobblestones because the stones mesh better), etc. It is now possible to run heavy trains at high speeds.
All-out replacement of link-type (screw-type) couplers with automatic couplers - On July 17, 1925, all freight trains were suspended and the couplers of all cars were replaced (passenger cars were replaced at night and operated bottom). About 3,000 locomotives, about 6,000 passenger cars, and about 25,000 freight cars were replaced. As a result of switching to an automatic coupler that has excellent strength and safety and is easy to connect and disconnect, we have achieved faster and safer work and improved workability.
Installation of air brakes on passenger and freight cars - Electric trains used air brakes using compressed air from early on, but passenger cars pulled by steam locomotives used weak vacuum brakes (freight cars had no brakes). no, it was braked by locomotive and caboose). The installation of air brakes on trains began around 1922, and by 1930 all coaches had switched to air brakes. It was possible to increase the driving speed by strengthening the braking force. Although the installation of brakes on freight cars gradually progressed, unequipped cars survived until World War II.
Installation of automatic traffic lights - Until then, only one train could run between each station with a blockage system between stations. By installing automatic signals and shortening the blocked sections, it is possible to increase the number of trains in operation, and a significant increase in transport volume can be achieved without increasing the number of tracks. First, in 1921, a semaphore-type automatic traffic signal was installed between Yokohama Station and Ofuna Station, and after 1925, it was gradually replaced with the current colored light type.
Functional differentiation of stops - When the railway was first established, one stop served as both passenger handling, cargo handling, train reorganization, and depot. However, as the transportation volume increased, it became necessary to differentiate each function. For example, Osaka Station specialized only in handling passengers, and a separate line (Northern Freight Line) was built for freight trains, preventing freight trains from entering the Osaka Station premises. Umeda Freight Station was built on a lead-in line from the separate line, and a depot for passenger cars (Miyahara Switchyard) was established along the separate line. Slightly closer to Kyoto, the vast Suita Switchyard was built to organize freight trains.
Electrification of trunk lines and tunnel sections - In 1919, "securing coal resources and developing river hydroelectric power generation" was decided as a priority national policy. At that time, the Japanese National Railways used a large amount of coal for steam locomotives, and in line with national policy, electrification of main lines and tunnel sections was promoted more than before. </h3>
<h2>Railway Evolution</h2>
<h3>Since then, railways have undergone various evolutions, such as high-performance trains, the appearance of diesel cars, and the world's first Shinkansen that can run at 200 kilometers per hour. And now it is commonplace for trains to arrive on time, depart on time, and for railroads to be safe. </h3>
